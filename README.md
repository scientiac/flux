A react native app to update blog posts for markdown based github hosted SSG.

It connects to your github and has the ability to create and edit markdown files on the said directory of your selected repo.

## Why?

My sister didn't want to learn git and GitHub just to post some posts and blogs on her portfolio. So, I wanted to make it easy for her to just write and push to publish, leveraging GitHub pages and static site generators without having to know how they work under the hood. 

And importantly, without having to pay a subscription to something not very essential while struggling to sustain life as a student.
